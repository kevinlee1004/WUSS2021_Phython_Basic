# WUSS2021_Python_Training_Basic

The seminar is intended for Statistical Programmers and Statisticians who are familiar with SAS programming. 
It is not easy for programmers and biostatisticians to learn new language alone. The seminar will provide basic concept and foundation of Python programming, 
and the seminar will provide its comparison and similarity with SAS programming. 
Therefore, Statistical Programmers and Statisticians have easier time to understand how Python programming works.

The basic Python Programming seminar will cover basic Python programming. It is recommended for those who has a little or no experience in Python programming. 
It will help SAS programmers and statisticians how to start Python programming and how to use Jupyter Notebook/Lab (the most popular python platform).
